    <h3>Crispy edges and a juicy middle, these skillet patties really hit the spot and are easy to whip up. Housed between two potato buns that soak up the juice, this is the ultimate bite!</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>4 potato burger buns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter softened</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef blend</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 slices of American cheese</li>
            <li>Favorite toppings and condiments</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Brush a 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet with oil and set it over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. While the skillet heats, form ¼ pound beef into very loose 2-inch thick patties. The meat should barely hold its shape. Generously season one side of the patty with salt & pepper.
                1 pound ground beef blend of 1/3 ground chuck, Kosher salt, Freshly ground black pepper, 1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>Butter the inside on the buns and place (buttered-side down) on the hot skillet. Cook just until the buns are nicely toasted (watch closely). Set the buns aside.
                2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 4 potato burger buns</li>
            <li>Increase the heat under the skillet to medium-high and heat the skillet an additional 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Set two patties, seasoned-side down, on opposite sides in the skillet and firmly press down on them until they are about 4-4½-inches wide and ½-inch thick. Season the top-side of the burgers with salt & pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the patties, undisturbed, until the outer edges are dark caramel brown.</li>
            <li>Flip the burgers and cook 1 minute. Add cheese and cook until desired doneness, about 1 more minute for medium-well. (If you like a medium-rare burger, add the cheese right after flipping the burger and cook just 1 minute.)
                4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>Set the cooked burgers, cheese side up, on a paper towel-lined plate and repeat the cooking process with the remaining burger patties.</li>
            <li>Place the burgers on the buns and add your favorite condiments and toppings.</li>    
            <li>Enjoy!</li>    
        </ol>
