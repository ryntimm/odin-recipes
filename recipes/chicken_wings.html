        <H3>There are hot wings and then there are Buffalo wings. Buffalo, New York, is the home of the hot wing, and unlike other wings, these prized poultry parts are never battered or breaded.</H3>
        <H4>Ingredients</H4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 chicken wings or 16 drumettes and wing pieces</li>
                <li>4 cups canola, vegetable, or peanut oil, for frying</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons hot sauce, such as Frank's Red Hot or Louisiana</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more if needed</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon distilled vinegar</li>
                <li>Brown sugar, to taste</li>
                <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
                <li>Blue cheese dressing, ranch dressing, or garlic Parmesan dip, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <H4>Directions</H4>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the tips from the wings and reserve for making chicken stock.</li>
                <li>Cut the joint between the drumette and the flat portion of the wings. Pat the wings dry with paper towelsâ€”this will ensure they fry up crispy, and there will be less spatter from water hitting the hot oil.</li>
                <li>Heat 3 inches of oil in a deep pan to 375 F.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a small separate saucepan, combine the hot sauce, butter, and vinegar over low heat until the butter melts.</li>
                <li>Taste the sauce to see if it's to your liking. If you'd like to reduce the heat of the sauce, feel free to add more butter, a little water, or some brown sugar. To increase the heat, add more hot sauce. Add salt if needed.</li>
                <li>Fry the wings in 2 to 3 batches for 12 to 15 minutes per batch, or until crispy and cooked through. Give the oil time to reheat before frying the next batch to ensure all of the wings are crispy.</li>
                <li>Toss the wings in a bowl with the warm sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve with blue cheese dressing, ranch dressing, or garlic Parmesan dip. Enjoy.</li>
